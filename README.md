### Translation Application

**Client Application (client4.py):**
The client application provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for translating text from any language into English. Developed using Tkinter, it features an interactive GUI with:

- **Text Input & Output:** An entry field for users to input the text and a multi-line text widget to display the translated output.
- **Language Selection:** A dropdown menu allows users to choose the input language from a comprehensive list of supported languages.
- **Server Communication:** Facilitates seamless communication with a server using TCP sockets to send text and receive translations.

**Key Features:**
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with simplicity and accessibility in mind, ensuring ease of use for all users.
- **Dynamic Language Selection:** Provides flexibility to translate from any supported language to English.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Utilizes TCP sockets for reliable and accurate text transmission and reception.

**Server Application (server4.py):**
The server application acts as the backend for handling translation requests. It leverages Python's socket and threading libraries to manage multiple connections concurrently. Key attributes include:

- **Concurrent Handling:** Utilizes threading to efficiently manage multiple client connections, ensuring responsive service.
- **Translation Accuracy:** Uses Google Translate's powerful API to provide accurate translations from various languages into English.
- **Data Logging:** Records translation requests and responses in a structured format for future reference and analysis.

**Key Features:**
- **Robust Server Operation:** Handles incoming requests with reliability and scalability, supporting numerous simultaneous connections.
- **Accurate Translation:** Provides precise translations using advanced translation technology.
- **File-Based Logging:** Maintains detailed logs of translation requests for accountability and troubleshooting.

**Statistics:**
- **Server Capacity:** Capable of handling multiple client connections simultaneously using threading.
- **Data Storage:** Logs translation requests in text files, categorized by input language.
- **Translation Accuracy:** Leverages the Google Translate API to ensure high-quality translations.

This translation system enhances communication by providing accurate and real-time text translations, supported by a robust backend and an easy-to-use frontend.
